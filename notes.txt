-Note spell-checker scope
-Note on user-inputted data tags
-make introductory sections succint
-Focus more on word analysis, language model, and predict
-Focus less on regex, focus less on introductory material
    ---Don't explain the entirely how Regex works, just handwave that
-Get to word analysis in 30 minutes
-Log(rank)-Density : This should be a side note
-Number cuts in regular expression
-apostrophe cuts
-Note that the data is lowercase in metadata analysis
-Presentation Quality
    --Explain things better
    --Spend more time explaining the structure of the packages
    --Go slower, elaborate more
    --Explain what a feature is, don't assume that people know them
    --Visualizing more of the functions (intermediaries)
    --Make things clearer in definition
    --Taking breaks and asking for questions
    --Better transitions, especially from micro- to macro-analysis
    --Better defining of terms: and keep restating those terms
-Content
    --15-150 stuff is complicated, explain that more thoroughly
    --explain more time on the packages
    --Cut down stuff for time
        ---Think about more time on word analysis and prediction pipeline,
            some time on summary statistics, less time on regex and pattern
            matching
    --Should I emphasize modeling? Or should I not?
