This suggests that we have many words that occur extremely rarely in our dataset and only a few words that occur relatively often. This is referred to as a distribution that behaves as a **Zipfian distribution**, which is a type of distribution where you have a few events that occur very often and many events that occur rarely. This distribution is fundamental to understanding the language-generating process within NLP.\n",

    "Before we begin trying to predict the age of a writer, we must first introduce the way we use language in the prediction process. **Features** are the components of your data you use to predict your **outcome** variable. In this context, our features are the language, and our outcome is age. However, how do I go about encoding language as a feature? This is the fundamental question of **feature engineering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, feature engineering often boils down to a way of representing each document in a corpus as some numerical vector. This numerical vector is referred to as the **encoding** of a document. Some would argue that encoding is purely for practical purposes, and would argue that an encoding of a document is arbitrary. However, NLP practitioners have shown how encodings place important assumptions on how a document was generated. The way we represent a document-generating process is referred to as **language modeling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling could be a lecture unto itself (which may be a good potential followup). However, for the time being, we will describe one of the most simple models of language generation: the **unigram**.\n",
    "\n",
    "let us describe a document of lenght $n$ as a sequence of words\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = (w_1,w_2,...,w_n).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to describe how this document is generated is through some form of distribution over the words that exist in the document. The unigram model assumes that every word in the sequence is generated **independently of the words before it and the words after it**. For example, consider the second word that occurs in the sequence $w_2$. What we are stating is that the probability of seeing $w_2$ occur in the document is independent of whatever other words I see in this document. Mathematically,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_2 | w_1,w_3,...,w_n) = P(w_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This essentially leads to the implication that the probability of seeing a document is equal to the product of the likelihood of each word occuring in this document:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(W) = P(w_1,w_2,...,w_n) = P(w_1)P(w_2)...P(w_n) = \\prod_{i = 1}^n P(w_i).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extent, the sufficient information we need to know to explain how a document is generated is just a **probability distribution over all words in our vocabulary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us simulate how this model generates language. We will take our current word distribution (see [Summary Statistics](#summaryStatistics)) and simulate a process of pulling our language from a hat containing that distribution. This is why this language model is referred to commonly as a **bag of words**."

    "According to our language model, these are dating profiles that can be generated. However, do these represent realistic forms of communication? Do these look like realistic self-summaries for dating profiles? It is apparent that the answer is no. This is an extremely unrealistic model for how our langauge is generated, most notably because each word is generated independently of each other in the document. Given the many phrasal dependencies that occur in real documents, this is not a realistic assumption to make. That being said, we will see how using this model of language actually performs reasonably well for the task of prediction.\n",

For the sake of simplification, let us try to predict whether someone is within the millenial age range.

For the sake of further simplification, we will assume that a millenial is anyone under of $28.$"

An **objective function** is some function that we either minimize or maximize in a way to find our weights. In that sense, the objective function is some measurement as to **how well our model is performing relative to other models**. We would prefer this objective function to be one that measures **how well our model is fitting the data**. The $L_1$ penalty is a component of the objective function that penalizes models that place to large of weights. To some degree, this allows our objective function to prefer models that fit the data well, but penalize models that are overly complex and assign too many weights to too many features. The $L_1$ penalty is useful **when our feature set is very large.**"

That being said, we see that \"unyielding\" and \"unsatisfied\" seem to also be strong indicators of whether a writer is a millenial or not. To some degree, this paints an interesting narrative: that millenials can often look at relationships as a new experience, something where they can have \"unyielding\" discover of themselves compared to a lack of satisfaciton in previous relationships.
