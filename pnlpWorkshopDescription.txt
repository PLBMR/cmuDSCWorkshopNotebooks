The field of natural language processing (NLP) has become a cornerstone of the
toolbelt used by modern data scientists. In this workshop, we plan to
introduce the practical components of NLP to give students the ability to
mine text for data analysis. Students will learn to process semi-structured 
text, build summary statistics on a collection of documents, develop models for
language generation, and create prediction pipelines using OkCupid dating
profiles. No background in data science is required, although a familiarity with
Python is preferred.
